# Chess-in-C
This was my first repository and it is dedicated to study the C language, to do this, as a starter in programming I've written a Chess game in C language with all the features but castling.
To use it, download the xadrez_C folder and compile it normally in the terminal:
"gcc xadrez.c -o xadrez.exe"
".\xadrez.exe"

To play, simply enter the coordinate of the piece and the coordinate at which it will be moving.
example:
"1 0" "2 0"
